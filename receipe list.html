        <ul>
            <p> 1. Make the dough ready.
                2. Knead it for 10 to 15 minutes until it smooth.<br>
                3. Cover the bowl with tea towel, and rest it for 30minutes.<br>
                4. For filling, boil the potatoes in salted water until cooked through.<br>
                5. Mash the potatoes and add all ingridients except ghee.<br>
                6. Divide the dough into four equal parts and roll them into tight balls.<br>
                7. Place an amount of potato mixture that is equal to or slightly more than the dough you <br>
                   started with in the centre.<br>
                8. Bring the sides of the dough around the potato ball and close tightly.<br>
                9. Flip the ball so the seam is on the bottom and roll out until it's about the size of the small plate,<br>
                   trying not break the dough or let the potato mixture escape.<br>
                10. Heat the tawa over medium - high heat, add a teaspoon of ghee, and cook the flat bread until golden brown on <br>
                    both sides.<br></p>
